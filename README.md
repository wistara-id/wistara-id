- 👋 Hi, I’m @wistara-id
- I have 4.5 years of professional experience as a software engineer for many companies. My core competency as a software engineer is strongly demonstrated in my adaptability to constant changes in software technologies and the fast-paced working environment in the information technology sector.

- 🌱 I am also a scholarship awardee for master's study from the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP), Ministry of Finance of The Republic of Indonesia, one of Indonesia's most prestigious scholarship providers with a very tight selection process. I use my scholarship to pursue a master's program in Computing and IT Management with Placement at Cardiff University in 2021.

- 💞️ I am currently seeking placement opportunities as part of my master's degree study. My goal is to achieve challenging exposure and experience in a global working environment to further improve my professional skills and personal competencies.
